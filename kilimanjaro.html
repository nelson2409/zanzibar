                    Mount Kilimanjaro’s three peaks were formed after volcanic eruptions millions of years ago.
                     One volcanic cone, Shira, is now extinct and eroded, while the other two, Mawenzi and Kibo, ‘melted’ together after subsequent eruptions.
                     Kibo is now the highest with its famous Uhuru peak at almost 6000m above sea level.

                    There is no single explanation for Kilimanjaro’s name and there are many theories as to where it comes from. 
                    Local peoples have looked at Kilimanjaro with reverence and named it ‘Mountain of Greatness’ (Swahili) or ‘That which defeats the caravan’ (Chagga) or ‘White Mountain’ (Maasai).
                     The Maasai have also called it the `The mountain of Water’, as it is the source of water for the area.

                    The origin and meaning of the name Kilimanjaro is disputed.
                     Although the Chagga people of the Kilimanjaro region have no name for the mountain, they call its two peaks Kipoo and Kimawenze. The peaks' names—usually rendered Kibo and Mawenzi—mean "spotted" in reference to Kibo's snow and "broken top" due to Mawenzi's jagged peak. "Kilimanjaro" may originate from the Chagga calling the mountain unclimbable—kilemanjaare or kilemajyaro—and explorers misinterpreting this as its name. This Kichagga language etymology relies on kileme, "that which defeats", or kilelema, "that which has become difficult or impossible".
                     The -jaro could be derived from njaare, a bird, or jyaro, a caravan.[5]
